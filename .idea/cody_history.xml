                      <text value="To create an `aws_route_table` resource in `custom_vpc.tf` and associate the two private subnets `Private-1A` and `Private-1B` with it, you can follow these steps:&#10;&#10;1. First, create the `aws_route_table` resource block in `custom_vpc.tf`:&#10;&#10;```hcl&#10;resource &quot;aws_route_table&quot; &quot;private_route_table&quot; {&#10;  vpc_id = aws_vpc.custom_vpc.id&#10;&#10;  tags = {&#10;    Name = &quot;Private Route Table&quot;&#10;  }&#10;}&#10;```&#10;&#10;This will create a new route table named &quot;Private Route Table&quot; within the custom VPC.&#10;&#10;2. Next, associate the two private subnets with the route table using the `aws_route_table_association` resource:&#10;&#10;```hcl&#10;resource &quot;aws_route_table_association&quot; &quot;private_1a&quot; {&#10;  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.private_1a.id&#10;  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private_route_table.id&#10;}&#10;&#10;resource &quot;aws_route_table_association&quot; &quot;private_1b&quot; {&#10;  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.private_1b.id&#10;  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private_route_table.id&#10;}&#10;```&#10;&#10;Here, we're creating two `aws_route_table_association` resources, one for each private subnet. The `subnet_id` is the ID of the respective private subnet (`aws_subnet.private_1a.id` and `aws_subnet.private_1b.id`), and the `route_table_id` is the ID of the route table we created earlier (`aws_route_table.private_route_table.id`).&#10;&#10;Make sure to replace `aws_subnet.private_1a` and `aws_subnet.private_1b` with the actual resource names you have defined in `custom_vpc.tf` for the two private subnets.&#10;&#10;After applying these changes, the two private subnets `Private-1A` and `Private-1B` will be associated with the newly created &quot;Private Route Table&quot; within the custom VPC." />

                      <text value="To create an Elastic IP address in Terraform, which can be used by a NAT Gateway, you can use the `aws_eip` resource. Here's an example:&#10;&#10;```hcl&#10;resource &quot;aws_eip&quot; &quot;nat_gateway_eip&quot; {&#10;  vpc   = true&#10;  tags = {&#10;    Name = &quot;NAT Gateway EIP&quot;&#10;  }&#10;}&#10;```&#10;&#10;This will create an Elastic IP address in the same VPC as your other resources. The `vpc = true` argument specifies that the Elastic IP should be associated with the VPC instead of a specific instance.&#10;&#10;After creating the Elastic IP, you can then use it when creating the NAT Gateway resource. Here's an example of creating a NAT Gateway using the Elastic IP:&#10;&#10;```hcl&#10;resource &quot;aws_nat_gateway&quot; &quot;nat_gateway&quot; {&#10;  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat_gateway_eip.id&#10;  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id&#10;&#10;  tags = {&#10;    Name = &quot;NAT Gateway&quot;&#10;  }&#10;&#10;  # To ensure proper ordering, it is recommended to add an explicit dependency&#10;  # on the Internet Gateway for the VPC.&#10;  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.custom_vpc_igw]&#10;}&#10;```&#10;&#10;In this example:&#10;&#10;- `allocation_id` is set to the ID of the Elastic IP address we created earlier (`aws_eip.nat_gateway_eip.id`).&#10;- `subnet_id` is the ID of the public subnet where the NAT Gateway should be launched.&#10;- `depends_on` is used to ensure that the NAT Gateway is created after the Internet Gateway for the VPC.&#10;&#10;Make sure to replace `aws_subnet.public_subnet` and `aws_internet_gateway.custom_vpc_igw` with the actual resource names you have defined in your Terraform configuration for the public subnet and Internet Gateway, respectively.&#10;&#10;After applying these changes, Terraform will create an Elastic IP address and a NAT Gateway associated with that Elastic IP in the specified public subnet." />

                      <text value="The comment &quot;use domain attribute instead on line 92&quot; is likely referring to a specific line in your Terraform code where you might be using an attribute other than `domain` to reference a domain name or domain-related resource.&#10;&#10;In Terraform, the `domain` attribute is commonly used when working with resources related to domain names, such as Route53 hosted zones or DNS records. For example, when creating an `aws_route53_record` resource, you would typically use the `domain` attribute to specify the domain name for which the record should be created.&#10;&#10;Here's an example of how the `domain` attribute might be used in an `aws_route53_record` resource:&#10;&#10;```hcl&#10;resource &quot;aws_route53_record&quot; &quot;example&quot; {&#10;  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.example.zone_id&#10;  name    = &quot;www.example.com&quot;&#10;  type    = &quot;A&quot;&#10;  ttl     = 300&#10;  records = [&quot;192.0.2.1&quot;]&#10;}&#10;```&#10;&#10;In this example, the `name` attribute is set to `&quot;www.example.com&quot;`, which represents the domain name for the record being created.&#10;&#10;The comment &quot;use domain attribute instead on line 92&quot; suggests that, on line 92 of your Terraform code, you might be using a different attribute (e.g., `name`) to represent the domain name, and the recommendation is to use the `domain` attribute instead for better clarity or consistency.&#10;&#10;Without seeing the specific line of code in question, it's difficult to provide a more specific explanation. However, if you share the relevant part of your Terraform code, I can provide more context and guidance on how to use the `domain` attribute appropriately." />

                      <text value="Based on the information you provided, it seems that the comment &quot;use domain attribute instead on line 92&quot; is referring to the `aws_eip` resource block in your `custom_vpc.tf` file.&#10;&#10;The `aws_eip` resource is used to create an Elastic IP address in AWS. It does not have a `domain` attribute, as Elastic IP addresses are not directly related to domain names.&#10;&#10;The comment &quot;argument is deprecated&quot; suggests that you might be using an outdated or deprecated argument in the `aws_eip` resource block. Without seeing the actual code, it's difficult to determine which argument is being referred to.&#10;&#10;However, here's an example of how you can create an `aws_eip` resource in Terraform without using any deprecated arguments:&#10;&#10;```hcl&#10;resource &quot;aws_eip&quot; &quot;nat_gateway_eip&quot; {&#10;  vpc = true&#10;  tags = {&#10;    Name = &quot;NAT Gateway EIP&quot;&#10;  }&#10;}&#10;```&#10;&#10;In this example:&#10;&#10;- `vpc = true` specifies that the Elastic IP address should be associated with the VPC instead of a specific instance.&#10;- `tags` is used to add a tag to the Elastic IP address for identification purposes.&#10;&#10;If you're still encountering the &quot;argument is deprecated&quot; error, you might need to update your Terraform provider version or check the documentation for the specific version of the AWS provider you're using to see if there are any changes or deprecations related to the `aws_eip` resource.&#10;&#10;Regarding the &quot;use domain attribute instead&quot; comment, it seems to be a misplaced or incorrect comment, as the `aws_eip` resource does not have a `domain` attribute. You can safely ignore that part of the comment when working with the `aws_eip` resource." />

                      <text value="Ah, I see. The `vpc = true` argument in the `aws_eip` resource is deprecated in the latest versions of the AWS provider for Terraform.&#10;&#10;Instead of using `vpc = true`, you should now use the `vpc` argument and set it to the ID of the VPC where you want to create the Elastic IP address.&#10;&#10;Here's an updated example of how to create an `aws_eip` resource without using the deprecated `vpc = true` argument:&#10;&#10;```hcl&#10;resource &quot;aws_eip&quot; &quot;nat_gateway_eip&quot; {&#10;  vpc   = aws_vpc.custom_vpc.id&#10;  tags = {&#10;    Name = &quot;NAT Gateway EIP&quot;&#10;  }&#10;}&#10;```&#10;&#10;In this example:&#10;&#10;- `vpc` is set to `aws_vpc.custom_vpc.id`, which is the ID of the VPC resource you have defined in your `custom_vpc.tf` file.&#10;- `tags` is used to add a tag to the Elastic IP address for identification purposes.&#10;&#10;Make sure to replace `aws_vpc.custom_vpc` with the actual name of your VPC resource if it's different.&#10;&#10;By using the `vpc` argument and setting it to the VPC ID, you're specifying that the Elastic IP address should be created within the specified VPC, instead of using the deprecated `vpc = true` argument.&#10;&#10;This change should resolve the &quot;argument is deprecated&quot; error you're encountering on line 92 of your `custom_vpc.tf` file when creating the `aws_eip` resource." />
