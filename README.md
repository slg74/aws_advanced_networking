# aws_advanced_networking

Course is delivered in AWS console.  

I'm doing the examples with terraform. 

This Terraform would be broken up into separate reusable modules.  
This is for learning purposes for AWS advanced networking concepts.  


It's also wide open, so... run a 'terraform destroy' right after validating that it works.
